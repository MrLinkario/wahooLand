Keep this in mind.

I used Blender when working with this model. Now, you should be just fine when working with any other editor. BUT,
if you are going to edit this model in ANY VERSION OF GOOGLE SKETCHUP, YOU MUST RUN THIS THROUGH ANOTHER MODEL
EDITING PROGRAM FIRST! THIS ALSO GOES FOR ANY OTHER OoT3D OR MM3D MODELS! ITS SOMETHING WITH THE WAY GREZZO DID
THE TEXTURE MAPPING.

ALSO, THIS MODEL'S TEXTURES ARE VIEWED IN MATERIAL MODE IN BLENDER. :)
